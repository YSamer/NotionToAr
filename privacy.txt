Notes for Notion RTL:
In Notion, you can set the page or block to Right-to-Left (RTL) text direction by:

Selecting the text block → Click the three dots menu → Choose Right-to-Left

Or if your entire page is RTL, set the page language accordingly.

This way, your English text can flow RTL if you want, or you can mix Arabic and English easily.
